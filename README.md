# Kickstarter landing page 

The landing page was developed using the BEM methodology, which allowed for a clear and organized style structure and markup. To increase the efficiency of development, I used the SASS preprocessor, which helps to create and maintain styles faster.

In addition, I provided a responsive layout that allows the site to look and work optimally on different devices and screen sizes. Whether you're accessing the site on a large-screen desktop computer, tablet, or mobile device, you'll have a comfortable and enjoyable user experience.

Desktop (>1280px) 
Tablet (>640px)
Mobile (> 320px)
